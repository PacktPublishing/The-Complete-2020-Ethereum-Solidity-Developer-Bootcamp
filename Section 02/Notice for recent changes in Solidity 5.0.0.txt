A Notice for recent changes in Solidity 5.0.0
Hi there!



There were some recent changes in Solidity and Remix. The community has released version 5.0.0 of Solidity, but it doesn't seem like it's working quite well yet. (Date: Nov 16, 2018).

If you run into problems, try to change the compiler version or just click the link below and it should auto-select the right compiler. This way you can run smoothly through the labs in this course.

Check if the right compiler version is selected:
